This assignment is in three parts:

Part A

Write a program that does the following:

Declare a fullword NUM1 with the value 249.
Declare a fullword NUM2 with the value 117.
Subtract NUM2 from NUM1. To do this, simply load these numbers into registers and use an SR instruction.
Add NUM2 to NUM1. To do this, load the two numbers into registers (a different pair of registers) and use an AR instruction.
Now use an XDUMP to dump out the registers and look at the register values to see your answer. This just requires XDUMP with no arguments.
Part B

Modify the program from Part A as follows:

Declare two consecutive fullwords of storage called DIFF and SUM.
Store (ST) the first answer (NUM1 minus NUM2) into DIFF.
Store (ST) the second answer (NUM1 plus NUM2) into SUM..
Use XDUMP to print the values in that area of storage (containing RESULT1 and RESULT2).
To use XDUMP, you need XDUMP followed by the label followed by the length of the field like this: XDUMP DIFF,8.

Go into the XDUMP output and verify your math is correct.
Part C

Now rewrite your program using explicit addressing. This means that in the L and ST lines, take out your labels and fill in the addresses of the various fullwords. You can get these addresses from the previous XDUMP output.

Other Notes

Start with the JCL and the trivial little program we had in the lab training exercise. Take out the two SR lines and put in what you need.

Be sure your name and the assignment number (including Part A, B or C) is included in the documentation for each file.

Turn in all three program files (from Parts A, B and C) and the output file from Part C.
